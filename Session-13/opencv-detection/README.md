# OPEN CV Implementation for Object Detection

- Opencv: also opencv has a deep learning framework that works with YOLO. Just make sure you have opencv 3.4.2 at least.
- Advantage: it works without needing to install anything except opencv.
- Disadvantage: it only works with CPU, so you can’t get really high speed to process videos in real time.

- Weight file: it’s the trained model, the core of the algorithm to detect the objects.
- Cfg file: it’s the configuration file, where there are all the settings of the algorithm.
- Name files: contains the name of the objects that the algorithm can detect.
